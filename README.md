# 🧱 Mini Blockchain Simulation

## 📌 Objective

This project is a simulation of a simple blockchain to demonstrate core blockchain concepts such as block linking, hash-based integrity, proof-of-work mining, and various consensus mechanisms including PoW, PoS, and DPoS.

## 🧩 Key Features

### ✅ Blockchain Simulation

* Creates 3 linked blocks
* Shows how tampering a block breaks the chain
* SHA-256 based hashing

### ⛏️ Nonce Mining (Proof-of-Work)

* Simulates mining with adjustable difficulty
* Displays nonce attempts and time taken

### 🧠 Consensus Mechanism Demo

* Simulates PoW (highest power wins)
* Simulates PoS (highest stake wins)
* Simulates DPoS (majority vote picks validator)
